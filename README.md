# Description

Diyu is a unique game created by the IsoLab Inc team. The purpose of this project is to learn how to search informations, read documentation and to code properly with other people by using Git.
This is an educational project during EPITA's first year.

# The Project

The actual results of this project can be found in the 'dragon-merge' branch. It was decided by the team to continue the development using Romain's features as they were more reliable and more advanced than the 'main' ones. We did not take the time to merge onto 'main' because of lack of time during the final rush. We thought that fixing conflicts would waste time needed to finish the project.
